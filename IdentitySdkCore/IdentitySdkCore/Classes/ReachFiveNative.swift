// On naming and signature for methods:
// first argument indicates modality to distinguish the two primary way UI is shown to user: Modal and AutoFill
// first argument label contains "with" instead of the method name in conformance to https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#give-prepositional-phrase-argument-label
// non-discoverable methods also take a requestType parameter even though there is only one such type:
//      1. to make it very clear that we are using passkeys
//      2. to be future proof. For non-discoverable, there is already Security Keys that exist and that we could support.
// AutoFill is @available(iOS 16.0, *) because ASAuthorizationController.performAutoFillAssistedRequests() itself is.
// The other methods control version availability with their respective Authorization enum to increase flexibility.
// For example the non-discoverable cannot be declared @available(iOS 16.0, *)
// because in the future we could support Security Keys, which are available since iOS 15
